## 🚀 Project Overview

- **Goal**: Automatically classify cancer cells from image data.
- **Tech Stack**: Python, TensorFlow/PyTorch, Scikit-learn, OpenCV, Jupyter Notebooks.
- **Dataset**: [https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/erdemtaha/cancer-data]
- **Main Features**:
  - Data preprocessing and augmentation
  - Multiple ML/DL models for classification
  - Evaluation metrics and visualizations

## 🛠️ Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Huz-123/Cancer-Cell-Classification.git
   cd Cancer-Cell-Classification
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   It’s recommended to use a virtual environment.
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Download dataset**
   - Place your dataset in the `data/` directory.
   - Update the paths in the configuration files as needed.

## ⚠️ Large Files on GitHub

**Note:**  
Some files in this repository (such as datasets or model checkpoints) may be larger than GitHub's preview limit (10 MB).  
**For example, one of the files is 15 MB. The GitHub web interface will only show part of such files.**

**To view the complete file:**
- **Option 1:** Click the “Raw” button above the file content, then right-click and choose “Save As” to download the complete file to your computer.
- **Option 2:** Clone the repository and open the file locally:
  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/Huz-123/Cancer-Cell-Classification.git
  ```
- **Option 3:** If you need to manage very large files, consider using [Git Large File Storage (LFS)](https://git-lfs.com/).

## 📊 Usage

### 1. **Train a Model**
```bash
python train.py --config configs/model_config.yaml
```

### 2. **Evaluate Model Performance**
```bash
python evaluate.py --model checkpoints/best_model.pth --data data/test/
```

### 3. **Classify New Images**
```bash
python classify.py --image path/to/image.jpg --model checkpoints/best_model.pth
```

### 4. **Jupyter Notebooks**
- Open and explore the notebooks in the `notebooks/` directory for interactive experimentation.
  ```bash
  jupyter notebook
  ```
